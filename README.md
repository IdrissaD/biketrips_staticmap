# biketrips_staticmap

An interactive map of my bike trips and the amount of kilometres I rode i each french department. This version is static, i.e., the choropleth map is just displaying a GeoJson layer with the number of kilometres embedded in the properties.

See it here: https://idrissad.github.io/biketrips_staticmap/

See the dynamic version, with live spatial analysis, here: https://github.com/IdrissaD/biketrips_dynamicmap/
